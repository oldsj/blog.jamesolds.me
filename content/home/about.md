## About

My professional career began in 2009 when I enlisted in the US Navy as an Information Systems Technician. I was lucky enough to be able to work on interesting projects with really smart people, picking up network engineering early on.
 After separating from the Navy, I became very interested in automation and software development while working on my BS in Software Development and Security.

I'm currently working on a CCIE RS while finishing up my degree.
