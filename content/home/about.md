## About

My professional career began in 2009 when I enlisted in the US Navy as an Information Systems Technician, but I have been obsessed with computers since the day my parents brought home a our first computer, a Tandy. I have been lucky enough to be able to work on interesting projects with really smart people, picking up network engineering early on. After separating from the Navy, I became very interested in automation and software development while working on my BS in Software Development and Security. Today I apply my knowledge of software development towards automating and abstracting infrastructure. 

In my free time I'm working on a Ubiquity EdgeRouter automation [framework](https://github.com/oldsj/edgerouter-automation) and reading my way through Nassim Taleb's [Incerto](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-4-Book-Bundle-Randomness-Antifragile-ebook/dp/B00K5190LE/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1522014462&sr=1-1&keywords=incerto).
